## Technical Implementation Priorities

1. **Security First**: Ensure all authentication, data storage, and API keys are properly secured
2. **Modular Architecture**: Keep components small and focused to avoid context limitations
3. **Sacred Aesthetic**: Maintain consistent design language throughout the platform
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure chat interface remains responsive and fluid
5. **Error Resilience**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Initial Development Focus

To create a minimal viable product quickly while ensuring quality:

1. Start with the authentication system and sacred access request flow
2. Implement the core Luna chat experience with Claude API
3. Add the Ko-fi subscription verification
4. Develop the credit tracking system
5. Create basic admin functionality

This approach allows for early testing of the core experience while building out the complete platform.
