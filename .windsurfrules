Use always ToDo.md list for tasks, check off tasks as you complete 
them and update the list as needed and add new tasks as needed and 
make sure to save the file after each update and commit changes and 
push to GitHub and run tests after each change and fix any issues 
that arise and continue working until the task is completed.
